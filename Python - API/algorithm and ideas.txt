I have
1. kda vs time of teams
2. kda vs time of random player
3. cs vs time of teams
4. cs vs time of random player

I want
1. stats at 10/20/30 min (team) (bronze/silver/gold..)
	a. cs diff vs win
	b. kda vs win
	c. gold diff vs surrender
	d. said cs diff vs comeback
2. roles vs items, summoner spells, cs, kd (mllib)
3. team comp vs winrate (?)

how to do
1. timeline data = 1
2. look at creepsPerMinDeltas 
	a. zeroToTen means 0-10 cs per min avg
	b. tenToTwenty will not be generated if game < 20 min
		so only get tenToTwenty if gameLength >1200
	c. total creep score at 20 = (zeroToTen + tenToTwenty) * 10
	d. this does not count jungle cs. so only look at mid/top/adc
3. get highestAchievedSeasonTier
	a. count per champ (if none, then silver)
	b. put priority up to low (challenger>bronze)
4. get inhibitorkill
	a. if 0, then ff'ed for sure. pretty early too
	b. if>0, we don't know if ff'ed, but they tried.
